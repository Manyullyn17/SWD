# Software Development

## What you'll find

* A metric fuckton of barely organized programs, that may or may not work as expected
* Demos
* Old non working versions of programs, the newest of which might actually work
* Random documentation that may or may not be badly written and or hard to read
* Maybe even some stupid jokes
